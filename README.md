### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Kushal Koshti, pursuing MSc. Cognitive Systems at University of Potsdam with a focus on using LLMs as agents for collaborative tasks

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on simulating various MLLMs including GPT4-V, VideoLLaMA, LLaVA on the [Co-Grip](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.587//) task in a Reinforcement learning setting. Apart from this I'm also working as a Student Research Assistant at ESCP Businss school and University of Potsdam (Colab Potsdam Group)
ðŸŒ± I'm in my 3rd semester taking following courses - Bayesian Statistical Analysis and Inelligent Data Analysis and ML-II. Previously I took courses like ANLP, Language Vision and Interaction and Models that Explain themselves
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate and learn about any topic focused on using LLMs as agents
âš¡ If I'm not on my laptop working on some code, you'll find me practicing 'popular' solos, playing chess or watching a Barca match.
